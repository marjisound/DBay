<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>
This is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down, so I'd like to take a minute; just sit right there; I'll tell you how I became the Prince of a town called Bel Air.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>In West Philledelphia, born and raised,</li>
    <li>on the playground was where I spent most of my days.</li>
</ol>
